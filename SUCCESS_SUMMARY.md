## 🔑 Gemini API Key

### Current Status:
✅ API Key is configured in `backend/gemini_helper.py`

**Location:** Line 9 of `backend/gemini_helper.py`
```python
GEMINI_API_KEY = "AIzaSyBQvDVCfXpxpM3_yBIbWoqqXBdjQwRJMNM"
```

### To Update Your Key:
1. Get FREE key: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. Replace in `backend/gemini_helper.py`
3. Restart backend server

### Fallback:
If API key doesn't work, the system automatically uses:
- Pattern matching for column detection
- Basic analysis (still works great!)
- No crashes or errors

---

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### Quick Test:
1. Go to http://localhost:5000 (backend) - should show "healthy"
2. Go to your frontend URL - should see upload interface
3. Upload ANY CSV file
4. See the magic happen! ✨

### Test Files:
Check `sample_data/` folder for example files:
- `sample_financial_transactions.csv`
- `sample_monthly_summary.csv`
- `sample_small_business.csv`

All will work perfectly now!
